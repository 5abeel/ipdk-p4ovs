This directory will contain files related to p4 server autobuild.
This P4 server intercats with any P4 client over gRPC.

In our use case, this module gets initialized from the P4-OVS component
in the north-bound direction. And in ths south-bound direction, it
interacts with the bfNode interface library and makes use of P4 SDE stack
to program the P4 target device.

This P4 server library code depends on the below open soure packages
to be installed in the standard library path.
* gflags - https://github.com/gflags/gflags.git
* glog - https://github.com/google/glog.git
* abseil - https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp.git
* cctz - https://github.com/google/cctz.git
* protobuf (v3.6.1)  - https://github.com/google/protobuf.git
* grpc (v1.17.2) - https://github.com/google/grpc.git
* nlohmann json - https://github.com/nlohmann/json.git
Note: All the above dependencies can be installed through the script,
     ./${WORKSPACE_DIR}/install_dep_packages.sh <SRC_FLODER> [INSTALL_FOLDER]
PS:- INSTALL_FOLDER needs to be mentioned for the customized path installation
     of the deps; If not specified, deps will be installed in /usr/local.
Additional helper script to uninstall all the dependencies that were installed.
     ./${WORKSPACE_DIR}/uninstall_dep_packages.sh <SRC_FOLDER> [INSTALL_FOLDER]

GIT submodules:
Please refer to the .gitmodules file.
p4runtime: https://github.com/p4lang/p4runtime.git
stratum: https://github.com/stratum/stratum.git
googleapis: https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis.git
SAI: https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI.git

Significant portion of the source code for the P4 server module is
resused from the open source stratum source code. Stratum code is
now added as a git submodule to the project for easy reference.
Some of the custom changes for the stratum code are maintained as
part of PATCH-01-STRATUM  patch file. This Stratum patch is applied
as part of ./apply_stratum_artifacts.sh script file.

Configure command for the OVS:(When building with P4 TDI)
./configure --with-p4tdi=$SDE_INSTALL

The order of the script(s) and P4-OVS repo check out/compilation are as below.
a) P4-OVS repo checkout and submodule update.
       git clone git@github.com:otcshare/P4-OVS.git
       cd ${WORKSPACE_DIR}/P4-OVS
       git submodule update --init --recursive
b) Install all the mandatory dependency modules using
       ./install_dep_packages.sh <SRC_FOLDER> [INSTALL_FOLDER]
c) Setup all the mandatory environment variables using
       source p4ovs_env_setup.sh <SDE_INSTALL> [P4OVS_DEPS_INSTALL]
   Ex:- source p4ovs_env_setup.sh /root/p4-sde/install /root/P4OVS_DEPS_INSTALL
d) Apply some of the stratum artifacts.
       ./apply_stratum_artifacts.sh <SDE_INSTALL>
Steps for compilation:
e)./boot.sh
f)./configure --with-p4tdi=$SDE_INSTALL
  Ex:- ./configure --with-p4tdi=/root/p4-sde/install
g) make
h) sudo make install
PS:- Alternately user can replace steps (c)-(h) above by running,
    ./build-p4ovs.sh <SDE_INSTALL> [P4OVS_DEPS_INSTALL]
